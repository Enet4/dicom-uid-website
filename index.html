            <h3 class="q">What is a DICOM UID?</h3>

            <p>
                This is the format established by the
                <a href="https://dicomstandard.org">DICOM standard</a>
                to make unique identifiers for DICOM objects, classes, implementations,
                and various other concepts.
                It is based on the OSI Object Identification standard (numeric form),
                and is a sequence of unsigned integers separated by dots,
                with a maximum length of 64 characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                For encoding purposes,
                the UID may also be padded with a single null character
                (<code>'\0'</code>) so that its length is even.
                The output above does not have this padding.
            </p>
            <p>
                The specification proper is in
                <a href="https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2023c/output/chtml/part05/chapter_9.html">part 5, chapter 9</a>
                of the standard.
            </p>

            <h3 class="q">How are they generated?</h3>

            <p>
                This generator strictly follows <a href="https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2023c/output/chtml/part05/sect_B.2.html">Annex B.2 in part 5</a>
                of the standard,
                which describes UUID derived UIDs.
                A UUID v4 is generated,
                and its numeric value is combined with the fixed root "2.25"
                to create a unique identifier.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this is done in your browser,
                so no data is sent to any server.
            </p>

            <h3 class="q">Is this open source?</h3>

            <p>
                Yes! The source code is available
                <a href="https://github.com/Enet4/dicom-gen-uid-website">on GitHub</a>.

                The library used for generating UIDs is
                <a href="https://github.com/Enet4/dicom-gen-uid">also open source</a>,
                written in Rust and deployed through WebAssembly.
